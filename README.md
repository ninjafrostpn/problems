A small set of problems to test how far you've come
===================================================

There are several folders in this repo in the 
structure each containing a PROBLEM.md file which
details the structure of the problem to be done

Difficulty
----------
- The first 8 problems are just syntactic problems 
  without any real difficult problem solving
- When I get around to adding any harder problems 
  they will be based on problem solving instead of
  just syntax nonsense

Submission
----------

- Fork the repo! ***Do NOT*** Try to edit it directly
- Do the problems
- Push back up to *your* account
- I will then check them and try to use this data to
  come up with some cool ideas for the club in the next
  few weeks
